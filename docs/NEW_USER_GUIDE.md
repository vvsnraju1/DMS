## System Overview

### Key Concepts

**Document**
- A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), guide, or instruction document
- Has versions as it evolves through the approval process
- Can have attachments (images, PDF, Word files, etc.)

**Version**
- A specific iteration of a document
- Each version has a status (Draft, Under Review, Approved, etc.)
- Only one version can be "Effective" at a time

**Status Flow**
```
Draft → Under Review → Pending Approval → Approved → Effective
                                       ↓
                                    Rejected
```

**Comments**
- Feedback on a document or specific version
- Can be marked resolved when addressed
- Create audit trail of discussions

**Attachments**
- Supporting files (Word docs, PDFs, images, etc.)
- Attached to specific versions
- Downloadable for reference

**Audit Trail**
- Complete record of all actions on a document
- Includes who did what, when, and from where
- Cannot be deleted or modified (immutable)

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Documents

✅ **DO:**
- Use clear, simple language
- Number steps sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include relevant images or diagrams
- Define abbreviations on first use
- Specify roles (e.g., "Quality Assurance Technician")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use unclear pronouns ("they", "it" without referent)
- Make steps too long or complex
- Forget to save work regularly
- Include personal opinions
- Use different terminology for the same thing

### Requesting Review Effectively

✅ **Good request:**
- Submit when document is truly ready for feedback
- Select the right reviewers (those who understand the content)
- Include a message: "Please focus on technical accuracy and clarity"
- Respond promptly to reviewer feedback

❌ **Poor request:**
- Submitting incomplete/rough drafts
- Asking everyone to review (causes delays)
- No message or context provided
- Ignoring feedback for days

### Providing Feedback as a Reviewer

✅ **Good feedback:**
- Specific: "Section 3.2, change 'usually' to 'always'"
- Constructive: "Consider adding a troubleshooting section"
- Respectful: "I think we should add a safety step here because..."
- Timely: Review and comment within 2 business days

❌ **Poor feedback:**
- Vague: "Rewrite this"
- Critical: "This is wrong" (without explanation)
- Nitpicky: Correcting minor typos instead of substantive issues
- Slow: Reviewing a week later

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find a document I created"

**Solution:**
1. Go to "My Documents" section
2. Check if document status is "Draft" (drafts only show you)
3. Use search box to find by title
4. Contact admin if still not found

### "I can't edit a document I own"

**Reason:** Document may be under review or already approved
**Solution:**
- If under review, wait for reviewers to finish
- To make changes after approval, create a new version
- Ask admin if unsure

### "My changes are not being saved"

**Check:**
1. Look for "Saved" indicator at top of page
2. Try clicking "Save" button manually

### "I got rejected feedback but don't understand it"

**What to do:**
1. Click the comment to see full context
2. Reply to the comment with a question
3. Ask the reviewer for clarification
4. Contact DMS Administrator if unresolved

### "I forgot my password"

**Request a reset:**
1. On login page, click "Forgot Password?"

**If you can't find the email:**
- Check spam folder

### "My session timed out"

**Why:** Left the system inactive for more than 8 hours
**Solution:**
1. Log in again with your credentials
2. You'll see your recent documents again
3. Any unsaved changes may be lost (use auto-save!)

### "I need access to a document I can't see"

**Request access:**
1. Contact your DMS Administrator
2. Provide: Document title, department
3. Admin will grant appropriate permissions
