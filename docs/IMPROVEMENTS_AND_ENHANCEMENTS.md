# Improvements & Future Enhancements

This document suggests improvements and future enhancements for the Q-Docs system based on current architecture, user feedback requirements, and industry best practices.

---

## Performance Enhancements

### 1. Database Query Optimization
- **Add database indexes** on frequently-queried columns:
  - `Document.document_number` (unique index)
  - `Document.owner_id`, `Document.created_at`
  - `DocumentVersion.document_id`, `DocumentVersion.is_latest`
  - `AuditLog.user_id`, `AuditLog.action`, `AuditLog.timestamp`
  - `Comment.document_id`, `Comment.is_resolved`

- **Implement lazy loading strategies** for large result sets (versions, comments)
- **Add query result caching** using Redis for:
  - Document lists (5-minute TTL)
  - User permissions (session-duration TTL)
  - Public templates (24-hour TTL)

### 2. Background Job Processing
- **Implement task queue** (Celery + Redis) for:
  - Email notifications (async)
  - Document indexing for full-text search
  - Bulk exports (DOCX generation)
  - Audit log cleanup jobs
  - AI document processing (long-running)

- **Use async workers** instead of synchronous email sending to avoid blocking API responses

### 3. Full-Text Search
- **Integrate Elasticsearch** for searching documents by:
  - Title, description, content
  - Comments and annotations
  - Metadata (department, tags, author)
  - Audit log entries

- Alternative: Use PostgreSQL **Full-Text Search** (FTS) built-in for smaller deployments

### 4. Connection Pooling
- **Implement SQLAlchemy connection pooling** (PgBouncer for Postgres)
- **Configure pool settings** based on expected concurrent users
- **Add connection monitoring** and metrics

- **Use AWS KMS or similar** for key management

### 3. API Rate Limiting
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse:

  - Per-IP rate limits (e.g., 1000 requests/minute)
  - Per-endpoint rate limits (higher for list operations, lower for create)
- **Use sliding window or token bucket algorithms**

### 4. CORS and CSRF Protection
- **Enhance CORS configuration** for production:
  - Restrict to specific frontend domain
  - Add request header validation
- **Implement CSRF tokens** for state-changing operations

### 5. Data Masking
- **Mask sensitive data** in logs and responses:
  - Hide email addresses in audit logs (show first two characters only)
  - Mask IP addresses (3rd and 4th octets)
  - Never log passwords or API keys
